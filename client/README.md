# TruthGuard

TruthGuard is an AI-powered fake news detector that detects misinformation and bias to combat the spread of misinformation. TruthGuard empowers you to separate fact from fiction and protect the trustworthiness of the information you consume. Hi! My name is Rishab Alagharu, and I am the creator of TruthGuard. TruthGuard is a winner of the 2023 Congressional App Challenge! I built the TruthGuard AI model using PyTorch and the frontend using React JS and Tailwind CSS. The model architecture consists of a Transformer Encoder with a classification head.
